&nbsp; I am Yuan You(游远), a master graduate from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). My research interests are mainly in the fields of SLAM, indoor positioning, robotics, and indoor positioning services. Now, I work at XGRIDS following Kaiyong Zhao and mainly responsible for the LiDAR 3D reconstruction algorithm. I am the **first author** of **3 paper**, including **1×T-IM**, **1×IEEE Access**,  **1×RA-L** ***journal***. For a detailed list of my publications, please go to the next page or click here to my [**Google Scholar**](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=p3hXCC0AAAAJ). 

&nbsp; In XGRIDS, my job responsibilities are as follows:
1. Post-processing Multi-SLAM algorithm
2. Real-time reconstruction for L2PRO/K1 and subsequent products

I am also an active open-source contributor, I will open source my work as much as possible so that more researchers can benefit from it. (The premise is that the company allows it.)
